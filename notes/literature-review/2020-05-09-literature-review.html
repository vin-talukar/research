If you draw your sources from different disciplines or fields that use a variety of research methods, you might want to compare the results and conclusions that emerge from different approaches.

Critical reading</h3> <ol><li><p>Throw away the highlighter in favour of a pen or pencil. 🔑</p> <p>Highlighting can actually distract from the business of learning and dilute your comprehension.
It only seems like an active reading strategy; in actual fact, it can lull you into a dangerous passivity.</p></li> <li><p>Mark up the margins of your text with words: ideas that occur to you, notes about things that seem important to you,
reminders of how issues in a text may connect with your research questions and objectives.</p></li> <li><p>Develop your own symbol system: asterisk a key idea, for example, or use an exclamation point for the surprising, absurd, bizarre, etc.</p></li> <li><p>Get in the habit of hearing yourself ask questions – ‘what does this mean?’; ‘why is he/she drawing that conclusion?’</p> <p>Write the questions down (in your margins, at the beginning or end of the reading, in a notebook, or elsewhere).
They are reminders of the unfinished business you still have with a text: to come to terms with on your own, once you’ve had a chance to digest the material further, or have done further reading.</p></li></ol> <p><em>Mark Saunders, Philip Lewis, Adrian Thornhill (2012) Research methods for business students 6th ed., Essex: Pearson Education Limited</em></p> <p><strong>Five critical questions</strong></p> <ul><li>Why am I reading this?</li> <li>What is the author trying to do in writing this?</li> <li>What is the writer saying that is relevant to what I want to find out?</li> <li>How convincing is what the author is saying?

Summarise</h3> <p>Galvan (2006) recommends building tables as a key way to help you overview, organize, and summarize your findings, and suggests that including one or more of the tables that you create may be helpful in your literature review. If you do include tables as part of your review each must be accompanied by an analysis that summarizes, interprets and synthesizes the literature that you have charted in the table. You can plan your table or do the entire summary chart of your literature using a concept map.</p> <p>Sort your findings according to a variety of factors: (e.g. sort by methodology and then date): examples of tables that may be relevant to your review; definitions of key terms and concepts; research methods, summary of research results.</p> <h3 id="_10-synthesize-the-literature-prior-to-writing-your-review"><a href="#_10-synthesize-the-literature-prior-to-writing-your-review" class="header-anchor">#</a> 10. Synthesize the literature prior to writing your review</h3> <p><strong>Using the notes that you have taken and summary tables, develop an outline of your final review.</strong></p> <p>The following are the key steps as outlined by Galvan (2006: 71-79)</p> <ul><li><p>Consider your purpose and voice before beginning to write.
Your initial purpose is to provide an overview of the topic that is of interest to you, demonstrating your understanding of key
works and concepts within your chosen area of focus. You are also developing skills in reviewing and writing; your literature
review should demonstrate your command of your field of study and/or establishing context for a study that you have done.</p></li> <li><p>Consider how you reassemble your notes: plan how you will organize your findings into a unique analysis of the picture that you have captured in your notes.</p></li></ul> <blockquote><p>Important: A literature review is not series of annotations (like an annotated bibliography). Galvan (2006:72) captures the
difference between an annotated bibliography and a literature review very well: &quot;...in essence, like describing trees when you really should be describing a forest. In the case of a literature review, you are really creating a new forest, which you will build by using the trees you found in the literature you read.”</p></blockquote> <h3 id="_11-writing-the-review-galvan-2006-81-90"><a href="#_11-writing-the-review-galvan-2006-81-90" class="header-anchor">#</a> 11. Writing the review (Galvan, 2006: 81-90)</h3> <p>Identify the broad problem area, but avoid global statements. Early in the review, indicate why the topic being reviewed is important.</p> <h3 id="_12-developing-a-coherent-essay"><a href="#_12-developing-a-coherent-essay" class="header-anchor">#</a> 12. Developing a coherent essay</h3> <p>If your review is long, provide an overview near the beginning of the review.
Near the beginning of a review, state explicitly what will and will not be covered.
Specify your point of view early in the review: this serves as the thesis statement of the review.</p> <ul><li><strong>Introduction</strong></li></ul> <p>The introduction should clearly establish the focus and purpose of the literature review.
The last paragraph of Introduction must detail the structure of what follows (literature review).</p> <p>If you are writing the literature review as part of your dissertation or thesis, reiterate your central problem or research question and give a brief summary of the scholarly context.
You can emphasize the timeliness of the topic
(“many recent studies have focused on the problem of x”) or highlight a gap in the literature
(“while there has been much research on x, few researchers have taken y into consideration”).</p> <ul><li><strong>Main body</strong></li></ul> <p>Depending on the length of your literature review, you might want to divide the body into subsections. You can use a subheading for each theme, time period, or methodological approach.</p> <ol><li>Summarize and synthesize: give an overview of the main points of each source and combine them into a coherent whole.</li> <li>Analyze and interpret: don’t just paraphrase other researchers—add your own interpretations where possible, discussing the significance of findings in relation to the literature as a whole.</li> <li>Critically evaluate: mention the strengths and weaknesses of your sources.</li> <li>Write in well-structured paragraphs: use transitions and topic sentences to draw connections, comparisons and contrasts.</li></ol> <p>The first or second sentence of each paragraph is typically the paragraph's topic sentence.
Transitions are words and/or phrases used to indicate movement or show change throughout a piece of writing. Signpost: Transition + Topic Sentence + New Topic
