# Methodology used of the literature review

Following [the master plan](/plan), the first step towards answering (and refining) the [research questions](/proposal/#research-questions) is to gather the following data:

- **the aspects of design that matter in enterprise UX**
</br>For example, "learnability" and how it affects the user experience of an enterprise software

- **metrics that are indicative of the above aspects**
   </br>For example, "Task completion rate" indicates how good or bad the learnability of the interface / interaction is

- **methods that can be used to measure the above metrics**
   </br>For example, using analytics we can calculate the number of people that started a specific task and the number of people that completed the task, this can be used to calculate the Task completion rate

- **review existing research that explore the correlation between the above in an enterprise context**
- **identify any gaps in literature with respect to the metrics, methods and how they relate to specific aspects of design that affect UX in the enterprise**
- **review existing research that explore the correlation between the above in consumer context**
- **explore if the conclusions from the consumer studies be transferrable to enterprise context**
- most usability studies are qualitative in nature, explore if these metrics can be gathered quantitatively using analytics

### Supplementary data
- How do researchers and designers gather this data today?

## Features

### Keywords
- user experience metrics
- usability metrics
- enterprise user experience
- enterprise usability
- user experience heuristics
- user experience evaluation
- enterprise user experience evaluation

### Inclusion criteria

- Restrict the literature to only Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs)
- Include more recent literature as that might influence the technologies in use (web and touch screen devices mainly), however historical research might be relevant for general perspective of the subject
- Majorly include studies on Enterprise software, however, studies from consumer software might through insights into generally how UX is measured
- Include publications with only objective conclusions

### Exclusion criteria
- Exclude studies on outdated GUIs like Blackberry QWERTY keypad, older mobile phones, etc...
- Exclude reviews and editorials, refer the original publications instead

### Sources
- Relevant databases
- Relevant journals
- Ancestry research
- Descendant search

### Quality assurance
Including 80% of publication from well re-knowned academic sources, 20% grey literature as described [below](#reputed).

### Bias reduction


## Criteria for selection of literature

### Comprehensive, yet relevant
Create a concept map to explore relevant and connected topics. May be mark each node with the number of references that different publications make, then filter the topics with most connections.

### Up to date
**Chronological Theme-based Literature Review** <br>Plot the publications on a timeline so verify that most recent research is included. Also make sure any historical publications that are still relevant are also included.

### Unbiased
Sources should not be included in a way as to progress in a particular direction.
- Make sure the concept map is wide with a variety of concepts
- The search keywords should include generic terms in the topic of focus

### Reputed
- Include around 80% publications from well re-knowned academic sources, 20% grey literature (websites, blogs, etc...)
- **Reputed authors**
   - H-Index > 10 for experienced researchers
   - H-Index > 5 for young researchers
- **Reputed journals**
  - In quartiles Q3 and up
- **Reputed publishers**
  - example, O'reilly, Oxford press, MIT press, etc...
