# Methodology used of the literature review

Step 1 of [the master plan](/plan) is to explore the following

### 1. Review existing research
- Explore any existing research
- Explore X, Y and Z independently
- Explore the correlations between X, Y and Z

_X = a set of measures that can represent Z.  Y = a set of methods using which X can be measured.  Z = a set of aspects of design that matter in enterprise UX. Refer [the master plan](/plan) for detailed context._

**Supplementary topics to explore**
- Explore X, Y and Z in consumer UX and see if they are transferrable to Enterprise UX
- What do researchers and designers do today to know how good their design is?
