# The master plan

This research project aims to find out **"how can we measure UX in enterprise software through analytics?"**.

To reach to an answer to that question, I am using a top down approach to planning this research project. The plan is a simple 3 step process, executed in the reverse order.

### 3. Write the thesis
Contribute original knowledge regarding quantitative metrics and methods for measuring UX in the Enterprise through analytics. Document the Summary, Details and Conclusions of the novel experiments I run. To do this I need to know what novel experiments to conduct.

### 2.2. Conduct the experiments

I would need a thorough understanding of what experiments to conduct and the data to be collected. I shall figure the details out in the later part of the research once I formulate the hypothesis.

### 2.1. Propose hypothesis
I need to propose novel hypothesis and either prove and disprove them. Though I precisely do not know what hypothesis I might propose, however, my assumption at this point of time is that the hypothesis will have the following generic format.

> ### The measure of X using the method Y will represent Z

where

X = a set of measures that can represent Z

Y = a set of methods using which X can be measured

Z = a set of aspects of design that matter in enterprise UX

### 1. Review existing research
- Explore any work already done with respect to the above hypothesis
- Explore X, Y and Z independently
- Explore the correlations between X, Y and Z

**Supplementary topics to explore**
- Identify any gaps with respect X, Y and Z
- Explore X, Y and Z in consumer UX and see if they are transferrable to Enterprise UX
- What do researchers and designers do today to know how good their design is?
