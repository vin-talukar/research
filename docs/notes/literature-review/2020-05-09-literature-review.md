## I. Methodology for literature review
This is a section of the literature review shared my professor.

### 1. Methodology

#### Data collection

Identify boundaries and develop a method to identify relevant literature


- **Identify the search terms.** Make a list of keywords that are relevant to your area of research, eliminate any unnecessary abbreviations that might lead to unwanted publications, make sure to consider plurals or synonyms.
- **Search period.** Make sure to include all relevant publications even if they are old. However, also do consider latest publications to make sure the research data is up to date.
- **Search the above criteria in authoritative academic resources and publishers:** ACM Digital Library, DBLP, ERIC, IEEEXplorer, ISI Web of Knowledge, JSTOR, ProQuest, Science Direct, SCOPUS.
- **Then search the same in academic databases.** Check your library for sources.
- **Summarise in a simple database for analysis.**
> (Shouldn't there be a program that does this on its own?)

#### Data classification

**Classify the literature into different areas and formulate a taxonomy.** A literature may belong to more than one category. This will help understand proposed approaches and aims in each category.


### 2. Results

#### Quantitative Analysis

- **Analyse the number of papers per year** to spot trends in interest of this topic by year.
- **Analyse by publication type (Journal, Conference and Workshop).** Conference papers are indicative of active work in progress research, while Journal papers and Workshops are indicative of well established research.
- **Analyse by year and type.** This will give the evolution of the research from active work in progress to mature knowledge.
- **Authors with multiple papers.** Helps establish active/established researchers in the field.
- **Citation graph.**

### 1. Concept map

**Method 1**

For more on this refer to [Mapping in literature reviews](https://as.exeter.ac.uk/media/universityofexeter/academicservices/educationenhancement/cascade/Mapping_in_literature_reviews.pdf)

- Identify your topic and write it in the middle of a blank sheet of paper – this must be kept simple and broad enough to allow for a more detailed exploration. It might be the whole topic of the literature review or just one area or argument.
- Write down all the words and phrases that come to mind in relation to the topic. These are likely to be useful search terms when researching the relevant literature online.
- Find, read and summarize key findings from journal articles, books and working papers.
- Most mapping tools will allow you to include links to the relevant articles, or an abstract/summary.
- Use branches to make connections between the words and references. In the case of concept maps, include a key that explains the relationship of the connecting lines.
- As you read more, extend your initial ideas using more branches and nodes.
- If the map gets too big, take aspects of the existing map to start another map and explore further.
- Consider how you can group your summaries and references in different ways.
- Build your literature review from closely related summaries and their reference sets, using the map as a guid.

**Method 2**

For more on this refer [Concept Mapping to Write a Literature Review](https://owlcation.com/academia/concept-mapping-to-write-a-literature-review)

- Basically the same as method 1 but build the concepts and connection by research and in retrospect rather than anecdotally.

### 2. Purpose of literature reviews

- Find out what information already exists in your field of research
- Find out other people working in your field
- Identify the seminal works in your field
- Identify main ideas, theories and conclusions and establish similarities and differences
- Provide a context for your research
- Show relationships between previous studies and theories
- Identify gaps in literature
- Identify main methodologies and research techniques


### 3. Benefits of a good literature review

- **What?** Identification of key question about a topic (Research gaps) that need further research (justifying research)
- **Why?** “Why?” Lending a theoretical/conceptual framework for research and placing your own research within the context of existing literature making a case for why further study is needed.
- **How?** Determination of methodologies based on those used in the past studies of similar topics.


### 4. Criteria for a Literature Review

- **Comprehensive** the main source relevant to the topic or question should be included
- **Relevant** the review should at the same time be discrimination and exclude sources that have little or no direct bearing on the topic.
- **Up-to-date** sources should represent contemporary thinking or research int he area concerned thought it is important to note that some literature written many years ago are still relevant.
- **Unbiased** sources should not be included in a tendentious way so as to advance on particular viewpoint to the exclusion of others.

### 5. Features of systematic review

- inclusion/exclusion criteria
- an explicit and reproducible search strategy
- specific means of assessing the quality of included items
- clear mechanisms to reduce bias

### 6. Structure of Literature review

#### Theme based

**Organize your literature review into subsections that address different aspects (themes) of the topic.**

To find appropriate themes, the reviewer may ask questions
- What are the key concepts?
- What are the key theories?
- What are the key sources?
- What are the main contexts?
- What are the key methods?
- What are the major issues and debates?


#### Chronological Literature Review

Try to analyze patterns, turning points and key debates that have shaped the direction of the field.
Give your interpretation of how and why certain developments occurred.

**Chronological Theme-based Literature Review**

`The reviews are organised and presented chronologically, in an organically linked, coherent, way if the purpose is to show the development of the topic over time.`

Also, you can combine several of these strategies (for example, your overall structure might be thematic, but each theme is discussed chronologically).

#### Theoretical

One among the themes.
A literature review is often the foundation for a theoretical framework.

#### Methodological

One among the themes.
If you draw your sources from different disciplines or fields that use a variety of research methods, you might want to compare the results and conclusions that emerge from different approaches. For example:

- Look at what results have emerged in qualitative versus quantitative research.
- Discuss how the topic has been approached by empirical versus theoretical scholarship.
- Divide the literature into sociological, historical, and cultural sources.

### 7. Process and steps

### 8. Critical reading

1. Throw away the highlighter in favour of a pen or pencil. :key:

   Highlighting can actually distract from the business of learning and dilute your comprehension.
   It only seems like an active reading strategy; in actual fact, it can lull you into a dangerous passivity.


2. Mark up the margins of your text with words: ideas that occur to you, notes about things that seem important to you,
reminders of how issues in a text may connect with your research questions and objectives.

3. Develop your own symbol system: asterisk a key idea, for example, or use an exclamation point for the surprising, absurd, bizarre, etc.

4. Get in the habit of hearing yourself ask questions – ‘what does this mean?’; ‘why is he/she drawing that conclusion?’

   Write the questions down (in your margins, at the beginning or end of the reading, in a notebook, or elsewhere).
   They are reminders of the unfinished business you still have with a text: to come to terms with on your own, once you’ve had a chance to digest the material further, or have done further reading.

_Mark Saunders, Philip Lewis, Adrian Thornhill (2012) Research methods for business students 6th ed., Essex: Pearson Education Limited_

**Five critical questions**

- Why am I reading this?
- What is the author trying to do in writing this?
- What is the writer saying that is relevant to what I want to find out?
- How convincing is what the author is saying? (In particular, is the argument based on a conclusion which is justified by the evidence?)
- What use can I make of the reading?

### 9. Summarise

Galvan (2006) recommends building tables as a key way to help you overview, organize, and summarize your findings, and suggests that including one or more of the tables that you create may be helpful in your literature review. If you do include tables as part of your review each must be accompanied by an analysis that summarizes, interprets and synthesizes the literature that you have charted in the table. You can plan your table or do the entire summary chart of your literature using a concept map.

Sort your findings according to a variety of factors: (e.g. sort by methodology and then date): examples of tables that may be relevant to your review; definitions of key terms and concepts; research methods, summary of research results.

### 10. Synthesize the literature prior to writing your review

**Using the notes that you have taken and summary tables, develop an outline of your final review.**

The following are the key steps as outlined by Galvan (2006: 71-79)

- Consider your purpose and voice before beginning to write.
Your initial purpose is to provide an overview of the topic that is of interest to you, demonstrating your understanding of key
works and concepts within your chosen area of focus. You are also developing skills in reviewing and writing; your literature
review should demonstrate your command of your field of study and/or establishing context for a study that you have done.

- Consider how you reassemble your notes: plan how you will organize your findings into a unique analysis of the picture that you have captured in your notes.

> Important: A literature review is not series of annotations (like an annotated bibliography). Galvan (2006:72) captures the
difference between an annotated bibliography and a literature review very well: "...in essence, like describing trees when you really should be describing a forest. In the case of a literature review, you are really creating a new forest, which you will build by using the trees you found in the literature you read.”

### 11. Writing the review (Galvan, 2006: 81-90)

Identify the broad problem area, but avoid global statements. Early in the review, indicate why the topic being reviewed is important.


### 12. Developing a coherent essay

If your review is long, provide an overview near the beginning of the review.
Near the beginning of a review, state explicitly what will and will not be covered.
Specify your point of view early in the review: this serves as the thesis statement of the review.


- **Introduction**

The introduction should clearly establish the focus and purpose of the literature review.
The last paragraph of Introduction must detail the structure of what follows (literature review).

If you are writing the literature review as part of your dissertation or thesis, reiterate your central problem or research question and give a brief summary of the scholarly context.
You can emphasize the timeliness of the topic
(“many recent studies have focused on the problem of x”) or highlight a gap in the literature
(“while there has been much research on x, few researchers have taken y into consideration”).


- **Main body**

Depending on the length of your literature review, you might want to divide the body into subsections. You can use a subheading for each theme, time period, or methodological approach.

1. Summarize and synthesize: give an overview of the main points of each source and combine them into a coherent whole.
2. Analyze and interpret: don’t just paraphrase other researchers—add your own interpretations where possible, discussing the significance of findings in relation to the literature as a whole.
3. Critically evaluate: mention the strengths and weaknesses of your sources.
4. Write in well-structured paragraphs: use transitions and topic sentences to draw connections, comparisons and contrasts.

The first or second sentence of each paragraph is typically the paragraph's topic sentence.
Transitions are words and/or phrases used to indicate movement or show change throughout a piece of writing. Signpost: Transition + Topic Sentence + New Topic
“Example: In contrast to [transition phrase] F.D.R., who maintained an
ever-vigilant watchfulness over the Manhattan project [previous topic + reference to overall thesis], Truman took over the presidency without any knowledge of the atomic bomb or its potential power [new topic].”

- **Conclusion**

In the conclusion, you should summarize the key findings you have taken from the literature and emphasize their significance.
